    Makes it easy to track changes.
	
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros: You can choose a good point to commit. So that commits are neither too small nor too big.

cons: Sometimes you forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Committing files together makes it easy to keep track of changes in files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is used to display the list of commits made, and git diff is used to compare two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    So that you are not afraid of loosing your work, and you can always go back to previous versions which are bug free.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To upload and maintain my projects.
